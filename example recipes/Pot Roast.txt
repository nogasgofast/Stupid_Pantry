Turn on the crockpot and set it to high.
On a cutting board or pan Pat dry the pot roast. Rub salt all over in an even layer.
Warm the skillet to searing heat (medium high usually) with a bit of olive oil in it.
While the skillet warms dice or cut the onion. I usually do a dice for myself and large cuts for people that don't like onion much. So they can pull those out.
Throw the onion into the skillet with the baby carrots. Stir warm them up. Getting a little char is fine.
Dice the potato into 1 inch chunks. throw those into the skillet as well again to warm them up potato may stick if you don't have enough oil.
Once the vegetable mix is warmed up and they look like they are steaming. Throw the mix into the crock pot.
Let the skillet heat back up a bit or until it gets up to searing heat again.
Put the meat in the skillet and brown it on all sides. At least 30 seconds to a minute per side. Should not be pink on the outside at all. It's helpful to use tongs for this part.
Put the seared meat into the crockpot and cover, turn the heat down to low. Everything in there is pre-heated. Turn the heat down to medium or medium low on the skillet. Follow directions for the seasoning mix.
Add a few more cups of water, scrap up the bits of fond in the pan. Pour the seasoning mix ontop of the meat in the crock pot being careful not to spill or splash.
Cover and cook 8 hours.
