Deviled eggs
Ingredients

    1 teaspoon Smoked Spanish paprika
    1/4 cup mayonnaise
    1 teaspoon white vinegar
    1 teaspoon yellow mustard
    6 eggs

Instructions
1. Place eggs in a single layer in a saucepan and cover with enough water that there's 1 1/2 inches of water above the eggs.
2. Heat on high until water begins to boil, then cover, turn the heat to low, and cook for 1 minute. 
3. Remove from heat and leave covered for 14 minutes, then rinse under cold water continuously for 1 minute. 
4. Crack egg shells and carefully peel under cool running water.
5. Gently dry with paper towels. Slice the eggs in half lengthwise, removing yolks to a medium bowl, and placing the whites on a serving platter. 
6. Mash the yolks into a fine crumble using a fork. Add mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper, and mix well. 
7. Evenly disperse heaping teaspoons of the yolk mixture into the egg whites. Sprinkle with paprika and serve.
